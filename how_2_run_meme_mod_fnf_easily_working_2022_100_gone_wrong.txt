ok so to play meme mod you have to extract the love folder from the zip to idk somewhere on your pc

after extracting it DO NOT open it it will spoil the mod

unless you just want to spoil it for yourself idk

then, make sure you have love2d installed on your pc

https://love2d.org go there and install it if you dont

then, oh fuck i just realized meme mod wont work on linux oh no 

well anyway, if your on linux just go to microsoft.com and switch to windows i guess idk

umm

yeah so then you gotta find the love2d shortcut

after that, drag the love folder onto the love2d shortcut icon

meme mod should open

its very quiet for some reason neither me or guglio could figure out why so make sure your volume is kinda up

not too loud but a bit louder than normal

and after that enjoy meme mod (not really its not fun at all)





DO NOT SCROLL DOWN UNTILL YOU HAVE COMPLETED MEME MOD. BELOW IS INSTRUCTIONS TO SEE ALL EASTER EGGS (except the literal hundreds hidden in the code where me or guglio left a little message, im not exagerating when i say hundreds)

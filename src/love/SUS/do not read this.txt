I TOLD YOU NOT TO READ THIS


but since you did it anyway


i'll tell you a secret



he's not actually the imposter

he's a crewmate


but


if the sus imposter kills him



something might happen





so its better to leave him there








and dont delete him









or change his file name








idk unless you like fnaf










ignore that last part










by the way, since i know youre gonna change the file name and then want to change it back, here is the original file name:
OH MY GOD ITS THE IMPOSTER FROM AMONG US.png
just copy paste it when you get tired of the game being stupid because you killed the crewmate
